# HIT238 The mobile paradigm



<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
## Some mobile apps
* What did you find?
* What did you like about them?
* What didn't you like?



<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
## Types of mobile apps
* Last week we talked about
	* Web apps
	* Hyrbid apps
	* Cross platform apps


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### Native Apps
* Build for specific platform
* Platform specific API
	* In a platform specific language
* Need to build a new version for each supported platform


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### Advantages of native apps
* Full access to device features through native API
* Faster because they are optimised for the platform
* Fully installed before use - interet connection is not required


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### Disadvantages of native apps
* Need to build a new version for each platforms
	* Which platforms to support?
	* More specialised skills are required
	* More expensive
	* More difficult to maintain multiple code bases


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### Android
* Developed by google but many different vendors
* The most popular mobile operating system
	* [88.7% of mobile devices run android](https://www.mobiloud.com/blog/native-web-or-hybrid-apps/)
* Many vendors and price points means many different devices to support
* [Many old versions still on the market](https://www.statista.com/statistics/385001/smartphone-worldwide-installed-base-operating-systems/)
	* How many do you need to support?
* [Lots of applications on the play store](https://www.statista.com/statistics/266210/number-of-available-applications-in-the-google-play-store/)
	* More competition but many are low quality


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### Android development
* Developed in Java (or Kotlin)
* Requires Android SDK
* Android Studio is an IDE dedicated to Android development


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### IOS
* Developed by Apple and only released on the iPhone / iPad / iPod range
* Has [wealither](https://www.comscore.com/Insights/Data-Mine/iPhone-Users-Earn-Higher-Income-Engage-More-on-Apps-than-Android-Users), [more educated](https://theappsolutions.com/blog/development/ios-vs-android/) users who spend more on apps
* Requires a Mac to develop for
* More controlled environment - easier to develop for


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### IOS Development
* Requires XCode to build images
* Uses Swift or Objective C


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### Android vs IOS
* End of 2017
	* 2696 million android installs
	* 612 million IOS installs
	* 8 million other installs
* Many more android apps but lower standard
* Different demographics

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### Discussion
* You have been asked to develop an application for a new ride sharing service
* User research suggest most users are:
	* 16 - 35
	* Technologically savvy
	* Cost conscious
* In your tables discuss which platform is the best to use
* Your client has identified a second demographic of elderly people who have trouble with traditional phone booking systems
	* Does this change your recommendation?



<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
## Mobile Context
* How is mobile different from other platforms?

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### Mobile != Desktop
* We use sit down and focus on a desktop
	* Often in an office setting
* Where do you use your phone?
* What are you doing when you use phone apps?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### What I do when I use my phone apps
* Watching a movie and want to know who an actor is
* In a car trying to find out where I'm going
* In a restaurant and my partner has just gone to the toilet
* Have friends around for drinks and need to pick a cool song to impress everyone
* Dripping wet, trying to work out how to replace the washer on a tap I just pulled apart


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
* Mobile is mobile: context keeps changing
* More distractions
	* Shorter, simpler interactions
* Privacy concerns. e.g. easily lost
* Different input interfaces
* Internet connection may be intermittant


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->

<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### Discussion
* What are some important considerations when designing for mobile?



<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
## User Research
[What is user research](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/user-research)


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### What is user research
* Answer some key questions about your product
	* What problem does this really solve?
	* Do people want/need this?
	* Will this benefit and integrate into people's lives?
	* Does the way it works make sense to people?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### Why do user research?
* Test your assumptions
* Identify hidden problems
* Saves going back and changing things later


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### Types of user research
* Observational vs Experimenal
* [Lab vs Journal vs Field](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/getting-into-the-mobile-app-user-s-mind-user-research-for-mobile-applications)

Notes:
Overservational looks to identify what happens in the real world while experimental tests a hypothesis
Lab is conducted in a controlled environment to test a key feature, journal involves a user writing down their thoughts and field involves going out and seeing what happens in the real world. 


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### User research tools
* Interviews
* Surveys
* Focus groups
* Diary study
* Card sort
* Prototyping
* Co-creation



<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### Conducting user research
* No one way to conduct user research
* Recommend [5 step process](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/09/5-step-process-conducting-user-research/)
	* Objectives
	* Hypotheses
	* Methods
	* Conduct
	* Synthesize


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
#### 1. Objectives
* What questions are you trying to answer?
	* Who are your users?
	* What do they want to do?
	*	What else are they doing?
	* Where do they use your product
	* When would they use your product
	* Why would they use your product
	* How do they use your product?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
#### 2. Hypothesis
* Acknowledge your bias
* What do you think you know?
* Sketch answers to your objective questions


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
#### 3. Methods
* How to find answers to your questions
* Identify methods to use for each question


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
#### 4. Conduct
* Conduct user research and gather data


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
#### 5. Synthesis
* Go over your data and answer your questions
* Did you answer your questions?
* Did you prove or disprove your assumptions?
* Do you need to change methods/activities to get better data
* Are there any new questions that have been raised?


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### Create a plan document
* Document what you want to test and how you will test it
* Allows you to communicate your plans with stakeholders and team members
* Formalises the process and ensures you address all criteria


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### Test plan sections
* Title
* Author
* Date
* Background
* Goals
* Research Questions
* Methodology
* Participants
* Schedule
* Script
