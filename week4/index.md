## MVP
The smallest thing you can build that a customer can use


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### How not to build an MVP
* Develop for everyone
* Look at the program functionality
* What is the first functionality you need to write
* What is the easiest functionality to write

### How to build an MVP
* Develop just for your target audience
* Look at the user functionality
* What is the core functionality for the user
* What is the smallest product the customer can use

### Why develop an MVP
* You can get user feedback throughout the process
* Test your ideas work with users
* Assess if users actually want your product
* Can address problems quickly
	* Less time wasted building something nobody wants
	* Less time wasted fixing something nobody likes

### An MVP does not have to be complete
* Many resources talk about MVP as the smallest product for each release
	* I disagree
	* MVP is a great way to release regularaly but an MVP is not a release
* Your MVP should be _usable_ not necessecary _complete_
* You don't release your first MVPs to public
* There should be a number of MVPs for each release


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### What needs to be in an MVP
* Have some key feature(s) to test
* Have a clear target audience
* Be complete enough to test the feature(s)


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### Some steps to develop an MVP
* Figure Out What Problem Youâ€™re Solving, and For Whom
* Analyze Your Competitors
* Define the User Flow
* List All Necessary Features and Prioritize Them
* Build, Test, and Learn

### How I use MVPs
* I usually have x number of sprints - then release
* Spread features across the sprints until release
* Each sprint has an MVP, development, user testing and a client meeting
* After user testing and the client meeting, the features for the next sprint are updated


<!-- .slide: data-background-image="../images/bg-smartphone.jpg" -->
### My steps to build an MVP
* Make a list of features to build
* Sort them in to core, important, desirable and unnecessary categories
* Sort the core category by priority
* Pick the most important - does it / do they depend on any others
* Sketch out wireframes and UX flows for those features
* Cut out anything unecessecary in the designs

### Reading
* The article [Minimum Viable Product and Design](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/article/minimum-viable-product-mvp-and-design-balancing-risk-to-gain-reward) is an excellent resource
* There are lots of other great resources but be careful
	* Many are advising startups on their release products
	* They focus on what a user will buy - not how to get user feedback
	* The different uses of the term MVP can be confusing
